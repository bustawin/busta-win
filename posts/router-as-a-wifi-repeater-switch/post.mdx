summary: Add WiFi signal to all your home using an old router, at 0 cost.

Do you know you can use your old and abandoned router as a switch and a WiFi extender? If you plug
an ethernet cable to the router it will broadcast that connection through WiFi and the other
remaining ethernet ports. So you can, for example, take the router to another room with poor WiFi
signal and improve it for free. In this guide we will configure it for that purpose.

The process is not very difficult, however you can't do it if your router is blocked. It can happen
in some ISP (ISP = your internet provider) routers. The only way to know is going to be to try to
follow the tutorial. Professionals can unblock a router by installing a <Note text="Like vyos.io">custom operative system to
it</Note>, but this is something we don't cover here as it is
difficult.

Routers have different configuration pages. I will put here the ones from an Orange LiveBox to
illustrate, but it won't probably be the one you face with; it's fine. This is going to be like
playing hide-and-seek: you will need to look for the **keywords** I say through the configuration
pages of your router. It is not so difficult as it seems, as they follow the same logic and routers
have only a few pages.

You will need a computer. I recommend macOS, which is a breeze in networking; then Linux, which
depends on the distro; and finally Windows... which can mess with networking, but it is doable.

1. Connect your computer to the normal LAN/WLAN/Internet you want to connect your router. Go to the
**network settings** and annotate the IP address, as it follows. For example, in my case I take
note of `192.168.1.102`. We will need this
later.![](router-as-a-wifi-repeater-switch/images/Screen_Shot_2018-01-30_at_15_37_07.png)
2. Reset the router to ensure there is no messy configuration. Routers usually have the typical
button you need to press with a clip for some seconds until they restart.
3. Connect the router to the PC **directly** through an ethernet cable and disconnect the PC from
other networks (like the WiFi).
4. The computer will try to reach the Internet through the router but it won't be able, as the
router is not connected to the Internet. <Note text="We suppose the router's default IP address is
192.168.1.1, which is the most common. However, it could be another IP. Un such case you will
need to write that IP. You can know that if you Google for the router
model."> We go to the **wired network setting** of the computer
and configure it **Manually** as follows</Note>:
![](router-as-a-wifi-repeater-switch/images/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-14.43.52.png)We **apply**. Note how the
computer is not connected to other networks.
5. We go to the browser and write `http://192.168.1.1`to access the router. If we have a _welcoming
screen_ asking for a password we did well. However, if we get a connection error it means we
didn't configure our machine correctly or the cable is not properly connected. Ensure your
machine is well configured and try again.![](router-as-a-wifi-repeater-switch/images/Screen-Shot-2018-01-30-at-15.24.44.png)
6. Introduce your router credentials. If you don't know them, which is the normal thing:
 1. The credentials can be stuck in the rear part of the router.
 2. Just try to guess them. Example of credentials for you to try are:
 1. admin / admin
 2. admin / 0000
 3. 1234 / 1234
 4. admin / 1234
 5. admin / (blank)
 6. admin / 123
 7. Any combination of the above.
 3. Google the model of the router like `router livebox XYZ password`.
7. Disable **DHCP (Server)**. This is where the hide-and-seek starts, as where this option is
depends on the router model. In my case, it is under Basic -> LAN -> LAN IP -> DHCP Server. Look
for those keywords in your router configuration. For example, DHCP is usually under a LAN page.
If you can't find the option, it can be that your router is blocked, and there is nothing else
you can do here :-(. Finally, **uncheck** the DHCP (Server) option and
save:![](router-as-a-wifi-repeater-switch/images/192_168_1_1_index0_stm.png)Now your router it doesn't act as a router anymore
but as a switch.
8. Look for an option (through all the router settings) called**DHCP Client**, which is usually
unchecked. Check it and go to step 10. If you don't find it is fine (I don't have it neither),
just continue to the next step.
9. Look for an **IP Address**field. In my case, that field is just above the DHCP Server one, but
it might not be the case for you, in which case you will need to find it again :-). Recover the
IP number we took in step 1., which in my case is `192.168.1.102`, and substitute the number
after the period with `200`, so it is like `192.168.1.200`in my case. Take note of this new
number.
10. Save it. You will notice that while saving your computer will be disconnected from the router,
which is fine.
11. Connect your router to your LAN/Internet through an ethernet cable.
12. Connect your computer to your LAN/Internet, through cable or WiFi â€“it doesn't matter. Remember
to go to_network settings_ and set the connection back to _automatically_or_Using DHCP_ (they
are the same).
13. Go to the browser of your computer and type the number from step 9., which for me
is`http://192.168.1.200`. You will access the router again :-), which means that your router is
already acting as a switch. If you can't connect, try to reset the central router that provides
you Internet and then recheck that you did everything correctly.
14. Create a WiFi: Go to the WiFi settings in the router (hide-and-seek again) and set-up a WiFi
connection, like as follows (SSID = name of the WiFi):![](router-as-a-wifi-repeater-switch/images/192_168_1_1_index_stm-1.png)As
a tip, if you set the same SSID (name of the WiFi), WiFi key, and WiFi security (WPA2...) as
another WiFi you have near there, your devices will switch between WiFis transparently, giving
the illusion that you are on a big WiFi.
15. Done.

If you need to undo everything just reset the router again.

Happy coding :-)
