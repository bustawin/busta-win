This is an attempt for myself to write cohesively, and a work in progress.

* I use typography rules from [PracticalTypography](https://practicaltypography.com).
* I use the following APA styles:
    * [Numbers & Statistics](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_numbers_statistics.html)
    * [Footnotes](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/footnotes_and_endnotes.html).
    * [Citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations), substituting the
      in-text references by less intrusive tooltips.


## Interesting rules

* Abbreviations
  * <C {...q.APAAbbreviation} direct>Periods are not used with abbreviations in APA Style.</C>
  * <C {...q.APAAbbreviation}>APA uses the *i.e.,* form.</C>
* Italics and quotations
  * <C {...q.APAITalicsQuotations} direct>Italics are used to draw attention to key terms and phrases
  when providing definitions and to format parts of reference list entries (e.g., titles of books
  and periodicals). Quotation marks are used to present linguistic examples and titles of book
  chapters and articles in the text.</C>
* <C {...q.hyperlink}>Not putting verb phrases in hyperlinks</C>.
