In this post, I explain why Iterables and AsyncIterables in JavaScript are great and why
the library I released—[iterated](http://iterated.busta.win)—is
a great tool to unleash their potential.
It is time to move away from only Arrays into Iterables.

Simply said, <C {...q.b}>an <dfn>Iterable</dfn> is any data or variable that we can loop.
This
includes [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/@@iterator),
[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/@@iterator),
[Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/@@iterator),
and
[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/@@iterator).</C>
Usually data is in arrays, so we use iterables already "under the hood"
even if we don’t know it.
For example,<C {...q.c}>when using `for..of`</C>:

```typescript title='looping with for..of works with any iterable.'
const values = [1, 2, 3]
for (const value of values) {
  console.log(value)
}
```

Javascript introduced iterables a while ago,
<C {...q.a}>and since 2017 is widely supported.</C> Other languages
like <C {...q.e}>Python had it since 2001, and they are a core part
of the language.</C>
However, in my experience, developers tend to focus on working only
with arrays
(e.g.,
[Array.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map),
[Array.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter))
instead of shifting their mind and working with iterables,
even if iterables have several benefits:

1. [Abstraction](#abstraction) over the collection where we contain our data.
2. [Avoiding intermediate data structures](#avoiding-intermediate-data-structures), reducing CPU
   and RAM usage, and allowing infinite and streaming collections.
3. [AsyncIterators](#async-iterators), putting promises into iterables to iterate with I/O and API
   calls.
4. They are a great fit with [pipes](#pipes).

In this post, I plan to entice you to move from an Array-centric vision
to an Iterable-centric one.

## Abstraction

The first benefit is **abstraction**. As we have several types of collections,
like Array, String, or Map, iterables allows us to make agnostic
functions that can work with any of these collections. Or said
in another way, functions that need only something that loops:

```typescript title='This function accepts any kind of iterables, including Array, String, and Set.'
function printValues(iterable: Iterable<any>) {
  for (const value in iterable) {
    console.log(value)
  }
}

printValues([1, 2, 3])
printValues('foo bar')
printValues(new Set([1, 2, 3]))
```

## Avoiding intermediate data structures

Transforming arrays of data means in many ways creating intermediate
data
structures <Note text={<span>Because
JavaScript <a href='https://hilalarsa.medium.com/javascript-map-will-only-shallow-copy-your-object-1579da63b98f'>
generates shallow copies of objects</a> this is not usually disastrous.</span>}>
that cost RAM and CPU</Note>.

In the following example, `Array.map` and `Array.filter`
create new arrays, so we now have three arrays: `input`, `x`, `y`.

```typescript title="Example of applying map and filter the regular way, which copy the array multiple times."
const input = [1, 2, 3]
const x: Array<number> = input.map(x => x * 2)
const y: Array<number> = input.filter(x => x < 4)
```

Iterables do not generate an intermediate data structure:

```typescript title="Example of applying map and filter with iterables, which do not generate array copies."
import it from 'iterated'

const input = [1, 2, 3]
const x: Iterable<number> = it.map(input, x => x * 2)
const y: Iterable<number> = it.filter(x, x => x < 4)
```

This is because <C {...q.f}>iterables are lazy: they do not iterate until necessary, only on
demand.</C>
For example, when a function forces them to generate an array.

```typescript title='Transforming an iterable into an array, creating a single copy.'
const result: Array<number> = it.array(y)
```

In sum, with iterables we avoid intermediate data structures, which is
crucial when working with big datasets.

### Generators and yielding

<C {...q.d}>The same way that arrays and strings are now iterables, functions
can be iterables too. Rephrasing it: **we can iterate functions**.
To tell JavaScript that a function can be iterated, we use
two things: the `yield` keyword and an asterisk after `function`</C>:

```typescript title='Example of creating and executing a generator function.'
function* iterableFunction() {
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3
}

for (const val of iterableFunction()) {
  console.log(val) // prints 1 2 3
}
```

For a function accepting an Iterable (like the `printValues` we defined
earlier) this is still a regular Iterable:

```typescript title='printValues accept any iterable, including iterableFunction().'
printValues(iterableFunction()) // prints 1 2 3
printValues([1, 2, 3]) // prints 1 2 3
```

<p><C {...q.d}> We call these iterable functions <dfn>generators</dfn>.</C></p>

A function that yields avoids creating intermediate data structures. We
can demonstrate this by comparing the implementation of a regular `Array.map`
and a yielding `map` functions:

```typescript title='Implementations of a map function with and without iterables.'
function regularOldMap(input: Array, func): Array {
  const newArray = []
  for (const val of input) {
    const result = func(val)
    newArray.push(result)
  }

  // By now we have two arrays full of data: input and newArray
  return newArray
}

function* yieldingMap(input: Iterable, func): Iterable {
  for (const val of input) {
    const result = func(val)
    yield result
  }
}
```

Even if both functions achieve the same:

* The Iterable one allows any type of iterable (i.e. `Array`, `String`, `Set`, `function*`)
* The Iterable one avoids creating an intermediate data structure (i.e. `newArray`).

And thus `yieldingMap` is superior to `regularOldMap`.

[iterated](http://iterated.busta.win) provides functions such as
`yieldingMap` (i.e., [`map`](http://iterated.busta.win/functions/map-1.html))
to handle iterables.

Finally, <C {...q.f}>thanks to their lazy nature, generator functions enable collections
of infinite values, such as computing the fibonacci sequence or streaming
information.</C>

## AsyncIterators

Converting the `yieldingMap` example to an async function
(e.g., for fetching data) transforms the return from an `Iterable`
to an `AsyncIterable`:

```typescript title='An async generator function that fetches users.'
async function* fetchUsers(usersID: Iterable<UserID>): AsyncIterable<User> {
  for (const userId of usersId) {
    const user = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/${userId}`)
    // do something
    yield user
  }
}
```

This means that in every loop of `AsyncIterable` it has to `await`:

```typescript title='Looping the users from the previous example.'
async function doSomething() {
  const usersId = [1, 2, 3]
  for await (const user of fetchUsers(usersId)) {
    // do something
  }
}
```

The beauty of this approach is that we only loop after fetching a user (i.e., lazily).

We can achieve the same without using `AsyncIterable` but increasing
the code boilerplate:

```typescript title='Same functionality than the previous example without using AsyncIterable.'
function fetchUsers(usersID: Array<UserId>): Array<Promise<User>> {
  const users: Array<Promise<User>> = []
  for (const userId of usersId) {
    const user = fetch(`${baseUrl}/${userId}`)
    // do something
    users.push(user)
  }
  return users
}


async function doSomething() {
  const usersId = [1, 2, 3]
  for (const userPromise of fetchUsers(usersId)) {
    const user = await userPromise
    // do something
  }
}
```

As JavaScript’s async/await is everywhere, having a simple way to handle async
calls helps to reduce code and complexity.

<C {...q.h}>AsyncIterables are specially useful when we do not know at the moment
of starting the loop when it is going to be done, for example when
accessing I/O</C>.

An issue is that the same function cannot handle `Iterable` and `AsyncIterable`
(because `AsyncIterable` requires to be inside `async` functions and
`for ... of` loops), so
we partially lose the value of having a function that just works with
any kind of collection of data.

[iterated](http://iterated.busta.win) fixes this by auto-handling
`Iterable` and `AsyncIterable` transparently:

```typescript title="iterated's functions (like filter) accept both Iterables and AsyncIterables"
const users: AsyncIterable<User> = await fetchUsers([1, 2, 3])
const successfulUsers: AsyncIterable<User> = it.filter(users, ({ success }) => success)
```

## pipes

When processing data, <C {...q.g}>pipes increase legibility by focusing on the
operations to do to over the data, instead of constructors like `for...of`</C>.

<Note text='Pipes built with Arrays loop multiple times of have to resort to intricate
implementations.'>Pipes are a natural fit for iterables because they both focus on the
data and the operations we want to apply on them</Note>.
The following example is what I use to load the posts of this blog:

```typescript title='A pipe that fetches posts from disk and filters out private ones.'
import it from 'iterated'

const posts: AsyncIterable<Post> = it.pipe(
  postIds(),
  it.map(fetchPost), // This returns a Promise<Post>
  it.await, // transform an Iterable<Promise<Post>> to an AsyncIterable<Post>
  it.filter(post => !post.id.startsWith('_')), // filter private posts
)
```

Executing the previous example still does not trigger loading any posts,
it only happens when calling an operation that returns an actual data structure.

```typescript title='Obtaining an array from the result of the pipe.'
const response = {
  posts: await it.array(posts)
}
```

Note how the function `fetchPost` only fetches a single post,
ignoring whether it is used in a collection, thanks to `map`.

A usual problem with pipes is following the **shape of the data**, specially
after applying several transformations.
That is why I ensured that Iterated brings TypeScript support,
inferring the data type in each step.
For example, the following causes TypeScript to complain:

```typescript title="An example of iterated's inference. Filter's 'x' is defined as string, and result as Iterable<string>."
const result = it.pipe(
  'foobar',
  it.filter(x => x < 3) // Error: operator < can't be applied to a string and number
)
```

### About the built-in methods

When handling Arrays, JavaScript’s built-ins use chaining instead of piping:

```typescript title='Comparison between applying map and reduce using the built-in and iterated.'
const withBuiltIn = [1, 2, 3].map().reduce()
const withIterated = it.pipe([1, 2, 3], it.map(), it.reduce())
```

And the JavaScript team is repeating it with the proposal
for [built-in iterable methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator/map):

```typescript title='Comparison between applying map/reduce with the built-in methods and iterated.'
const iterator = [1, 2, 3].values()
const withBuiltIn = iterator.map().reduce()

const withIterated = it.pipe([1, 2, 3], it.map(), it.reduce())
```

Although both methods work, `pipe` has an advantage over `chain`:
it is functional.
Thanks to this, we can easily allow to use `AsyncIterable` and,
most importantly, it is extensible.

By extensible, <Note text='I would be interested to know if there is a better way for built-ins to
handle
new methods, because the only non-over-the-top solution I can think of
is polluting the Iterator class itself.'>I mean adding your functions doesn't feel alien or
quirky</Note>:

```typescript title='Comparison of adding a custom function to an iterated pipe and a built-in chain.'
function doStuffWithDevices(devices: Iterable<Device>): Iterable<Device> {
  // Loop devices and so something with them
}

const withIterated = it.pipe([{ id: 'device-1' }], doStuffWithDevices)

// ???
Iterator.prototype.doStuffWithDevices = doStuffWithDevices
const withBuiltIn = [{ id: 'device-1' }].values().doStuffWithDevices()
```

And finally, a word of warning with the built-ins as [they don't work
for all iterables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator#proper_iterators),
which iterated does.

## Conclusions

Iterables and AsyncIterables are an improvement
when working with JavaScript, as they abstract us from collections
(e.g., Array, Set, Map, `function*`) and focus on our data, they iterate
only once, and they reduce RAM and increase performance.
Issues are changing our mental process and functions to iterables,
or embrace pipes.

Pipes are a good way to transform data with iterables as they focus
on the transformations we want to do to our data.
Although there is a JavaScript proposal for iterable chaining,
I believe pipes are more agnostic and extensible, especially
when moving between Iterable and AsyncIterable, and supporting any
kind of iterable.

Moreover, although there are many good libraries to work with iterables
(e.g., [iterate-iterator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iterate-iterator),
[iterare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iterare), [the new built-in methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator/map))
only [iterated](http://iterated.busta.win) brings all the following:

* Pipes.
* Great typing support.
* Iterable and AsyncIterable transparent support.
* Simple extensibility.
* Simple interface.

As its biggest drawback, [iterated](http://iterated.busta.win) is new and would benefit from more
and improved functions.
