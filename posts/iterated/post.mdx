summary: I published iterated, functional methods to work with Javascript iterables.
---

I released [iterated](https://github.com/bustawin/iterated),
a collection of functional methods to transform data in Javascript with prime
typing support.

```javascript
import it from 'iterated'

// result is inferred as Iterator<number>
const result = it.pipe(
  [
    { foo: 1, baz: 'x' },
    { foo: 2, baz: 'x' }
  ],
  it.map((item) => item['foo'])
)
// myArray is inferred as number[]
const myArray = it.pipe(
  result,
  it.array
)
```

It has great Typescript typing inference, pipe support with sensible
currying, uses the iterator protocol (`Iterator` and `AsyncIterator`) handling it transparently,
and it's extensible without coupling your code.

Feel free to [check out the documentation](http://iterated.busta.win) and
`npm i iterated`.

I, for example, use it in this website to load posts from disk:

```typescript
import it from 'iterated'

// posts are inferred as Post[]
const posts = await it.pipe(
  await postIds(),
  it.map(fetchPost), // This returns a Promise<Post>
  it.await,
  it.filter(post => !post.id.startsWith('_')),
  it.sort(postChronologicalComparator)
)
```
