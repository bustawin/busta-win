  <div className="lead">Hello, I am bustawin.</div>
  <p>—aka Xavier Bustamante.</p>
</div>

I am a geeky software engineer focused on product development with
a spice of academic research.
At day, I lead a *fantastic* development team to build beautiful products.
At night, I like to tinker with software, hardware, start-ups, and management.
In between, I do some biking, trekking, scuba diving, and a plethora of things
I am bad at.

Computer Science is a beautiful and joyful art that can empower people.
That is why I work on building solutions about sustainability
([eReuse.org](https://www.ereuse.org)) and child safety
([Qustodio](https://www.qustodio.com), where I work now);
advocate [open-source](https://github.com/bustawin/);
and collaborate with several universities
in [research focused in societal problems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WwvhOx4AAAAJ).

In here, I share my experiences in the hopes that are useful for others and my future self.
I talk about [Software](/software), [Research](/research), and [Management](/manage).
