  <div className="lead">Hello, I'm bustawin.</div>
  <p>—aka Xavier Bustamante.</p>
</div>

I'm a geeky software engineer focused on product development with
a spice of academic research. I enjoy tinkering with software, hardware, and start-ups;
and then sharing my experiences in the hopes that are useful for my future self and others.

I firmly believe that computer science is a beautiful and joyful art that can empower people. That's
why I worked in building solutions about sustainability (e.g. [eReuse.org](https://www.ereuse.org)), and child safety technology (i.e. [Qustodio](https://www.qustodio.com), where I work now);
I am an open-source advocate (see my [github](https://github.com/bustawin/)); and collaborate with several universities
in research focused in societal problems (see my [research posts](/research)).

In here I talk about [Software](/software), [Research](/research), and [Management](/manage).
