With Sphinx is easy to generate documentation of your python project, as long as you don't require
some custom code. This is a tutorial of how to create a quick & dirty Sphinx extension to
personalize the docs of your project.

In our open-source project, [Devicehub](https://github.com/ereuse/devicehub-teal), we have some
Schemas that configures our API (like a User schema), and we want to generate documentation for
those. The documentation takes variables from the schemas and prints them
nicely. [This is the code](https://github.com/eReuse/devicehub-teal/blob/master/docs/conf.py#L196), [this is where our extension is called in a .rst](https://github.com/eReuse/devicehub-teal/blob/master/docs/devices.rst#schema)
file, and [this is the outcome](http://devicehub.ereuse.org/devices.html#dh-thing).

In this tutorial we use our extension as an example of a simple Sphinx custom extension. We assume
you
already [know the basics of Sphinx and reStructured text](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/brandons-sphinx-tutorial/latest/brandons-sphinx-tutorial.pdf).

A minimalist Sphinx extension requires two things:

1. A class that extends from `docutils.parsers.rst.Directive` that has our code.
2. A function called `setup` that manually adds our class to Sphinx.

Both things can be in our project's sphinx's`conf.py`. If you check our
code, [you see our class](https://github.com/eReuse/devicehub-teal/blob/master/docs/conf.py#L196)
and our [setup function](https://github.com/eReuse/devicehub-teal/blob/master/docs/conf.py#L309).
Read[this Sphinx page that explains this class and setup function](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/tutorials/helloworld.html)
and then come back here :-). The following sections explore parts not covered by the sphinx's
tutorial.

## Extension class skeleton and arguments

Our extension has only one parameter (called too "argument"): a string with the path where our
Schema is, and we want our extension to print some variables of the schema and its subschemas.

```python
class DhlistDirective(Directive):
    has_content = False
    option_spec = {'module': directives.unchanged}
```

The first portion of our extension class is about configurations of our directive, passed-in as
class variables (here you have
the [full list of configurations](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/markupapi.html#docutils.parsers.rst.Directive)
of the directive). Leave `has_content`as `False`.`option_spec`is a dictionary of the parameters of
your directive and their type. Sphinx coerces the type for each argument, and the safest one to use
is`directives.unchanged`, which returns the argument as a string, just as the user writes it. In
our case we define a parameter called _module_, and the user has to write it like this in a .rst
file:

```python
.. dhlist::
    :module: ereuse_devicehub.resources.device.schemas
```

And our directive gets the value "ereuse\_devicehub.resources.device.schemas"
in`self.options['module']`:

```python
    def run(self):
        my_argument = self.options['module']
```

`run` is the main method of our extension. It is executed every time the user writes `..dhlist::` in
a_.rst_ file. In our case we use the string of `self.options['module']` as a path to import the
Schema is referencing at.

## Docutil's elements

The objective of our extension is to return_something_ to Sphinx so that it can translate it to
HTML or to a PDF file. This _something_ is a list of Docutil's **element**, and they define a
_link_, a _bullet list_, a _section_ of a document,
etc. [Here you have the reference docs](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/doctree.html). In
fact, when reading a_rst_ file, we can think that Sphinx parses the rst syntax into Docutil's
elements, and then tranforms them to HTML, PDF...

So, we have that a_section_ element in_rst_is the same as the Docutil's_section_ element.

### Element hierarchy

These elements have a strong hierarchy that you always have to have in mind when using them,
otherwise it fails:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| document  [may begin with a title, subtitle, decoration, docinfo]  |
|                             +--------------------------------------+
|                             | sections  [each begins with a title] |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------+------------+
| [body elements:]                                      | (sections) |
|         | - literal | - lists  |       | - hyperlink  +------------+
|         |   blocks  | - tables |       |   targets    |
| para- | - doctest | - block  | foot- | - sub. defs  |
| graphs  |   blocks  |   quotes | notes | - comments   |
+---------+-----------+----------+-------+--------------+
| [text]+ | [text]    | (body elements)  | [text]       |
| (inline +-----------+------------------+--------------+
| markup) |
+---------+
```

In our extension we return a list of `section` elements, as we create full blocks of content. If we
do something like this in our _.rst_ file:

```rst
Schema
******
The following schema represents all the device types and their
properties.

.. dhlist::
    :module: ereuse_devicehub.resources.device.schemas

```

Note that the header Schema is a subsection (HTML's `<h2>`), our module is inserted inside Schema's
subsection, so our module ends up being a subsubsection (HTML's `<h3>`), which means that our
module plays nice with the rest of content.

In the following sections we learn how to use docutil's elements by showing the ones that appear in
our project.

### Base: section, title, link

The following example of `run`returns a list of elements (which is what Sphinx expects). There is
only one element, a`section`.

```python
import docutils.nodes as n

def run(self):
    section = n.section(ids=n.make_id('the-html-anchor'))
    section += n.title('Text', 'Text') # Just add the text twice
    section += n.any_other_element_that_can_be_in_a_section()
    sections = [section]
    return sections<br>
```

The section can have an id, which is the anchor used in HTML/PDF for linking. In this case we add a
title (we need to add its value twice for some strange reason), and any other element that we want
inside the section (note the `section += ...`)

The following code shows ho to generate the hyperlink that takes you to the section (this generates
the `<a>`HTML tag, for example):

```python
ref = n.reference(text='a link!')
ref['refuri'] = '#the-html-anchor'
p = n.paragraph()
p += ref
# We can add the paragraph to a section
section += p
```

### Lists (bullet points)

```python
l = n.bullet_list('')
l += n.list_item('', n.paragraph('Text'))
sublist = n.bullet_list('')
sublist += n.list_item('', n.paragraph('Sublist!'))
l += sublist
# We can add to a section:
section += l
```

### Fields

```python
# Create a field list
fields = n.field_list()
# Create a field
field_name = n.field_name(text='Some text')
field_body = n.field_body('', 
    n.paragraph('Some text'),
    n.paragraph('Some more text in another paragraph.')
)
field = n.field('', field_name, field_body)
# Add the field to the field list
fields += field
# We can add fields to an existing section, for example:
section += fields
```

### Parse rst strings to docutil's elements

In our project we end up reading string variables with rst syntax. The following code allows us to
transform those strings into docutil's elements that we can add, for example, in our
sections([check the source code here](https://github.com/eReuse/devicehub-teal/blob/master/docs/conf.py#L300)):

```python
from docutils.statemachine import StringList, string2lines
import inspect

def parse(self, text) -> n.container:
    """Parses text possibly containing ReST stuff and adds it in
     a node."""
    p = n.container('')
    self.state.nested_parse(StringList(string2lines(inspect.cleandoc(text))), 0, p)
    return p
```
