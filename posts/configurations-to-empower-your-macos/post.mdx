Personalize the mac beyond what _System Preferences_ offers. I talk about quick-look plugins,
spotlight extensions, terminal configuration, and brew tricks.

Note that 1) I keep updated this list with the things that I actually use on my Mac, and 2) I work
close to the OS guidelines: these are not ugly hacks but (what I think) more or less correct ways
of achieving stuff.

## Quick-look plugins

Quick-look is the preview window of Mac that appears when you press spacebar on a file in
Finder. [In this page](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins) you can get plug-ins
that allow you expand the number of files you can quick-look. I have the
following: `brew cask install qlcolorcode qlstephen qlmarkdown quicklook-json qlvideo`.

## Search in JSON, Markdown… using spotlight

You can upgrade Spotlight to search more file types, for example Markdown, YAML, or JSON.

1. Download [this zip file](http://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/downloads/Markdown.mdimporter.zip)
from [Bretter Pstra's post](http://brettterpstra.com/2011/10/18/fixing-spotlight-indexing-of-markdown-content/),
which is a base extension for Spotlight.
2. Unzip it to `~/Library/Spotlight/` (create the _Spotlight_folder if it does not exist).
3. Edit with a text editor like nano `~/Library/Spotlight/Markdown.mdimporter/Contents/Info.plist`.
You will see a line with the following: `<string>net.daringfireball.markdown</string>`, which is
inside an `<array>`. You can add more `<string>` elements to this `<array>`defining file types
that you want to be searcheable. For example, I have `<string>public.json</string>`
and `<string>public.yaml</string>`. Find other
types[in here](https://gist.github.com/gereon/3150445#mac-osx-spotlight-enhancement).
4.
As [the post from Pastras](http://brettterpstra.com/2011/10/18/fixing-spotlight-indexing-of-markdown-content/)
says, execute `mdimport -r ~/Library/Spotlight/Markdown.mdimporter` to load this new configuration.
5. Execute `sudo mdutil -E /` to re-index (with the new configuration). This will take time.

## Terminal

Enhancements to the default bash terminal. Many of them can be performed to any Unix with bash (
like debian).

### Personalize the terminal

The default _bash_terminal in the Mac is just too plain and too white. You can upgrade the
expierence by personalizing bash, for example changing colors or the information it displays (ex.
the path you are in, username, name of active virtualenv...). To achieve this:

- (Mac only): download a terminal theme
from [macos-therminal-theme](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes)and follow the
instructions of the website.
- To personalize what bash prints on screen you will need to make some bash code. This bash code
must be placed in your `~/.bash_profile`. What I do is have this code in a file in a sync folder
in the cloud, and then write the following in
_bash\_profile_: `. /path/to/my/file.sh`. [Here you have](http://ezprompt.net) a WYSIWYG that
auto-generates the code for you.

### Set locale to UTF8

Mac messes with your locales in the terminal, which caused me some problems. For me has proven good
to just do the following at every mac installation and forget about it.

1. Go to _Preferences_in the terminal > _Profiles_\> select your profile > _Advanced_\> untick _set
locale environment variables during startup_.
2. Paste the following in your `~/.bash_profile`:

```shell
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF
```

Mac does not have **nano**as the default terminal text editor. Add the following to
your `~/.bash_profile`: `export EDITOR=nano`. Softwares like _git_
\[note\]Reference https://superuser.com/a/504561\[/note\] select an editor from this variable.

## Brew

Interesting stuff with the defacto package manager of Mac, [brew](https://brew.sh/).

### Execute packages installed with brew

Brew installs packages in a way that it doesn't mess with your system, meaning that you cannot do
something like (imagine we installed postgres through brew): `$ psql`–it will print a
nice `command not found`.

Write something like the following in your `~./bash_profile` (in this example we want to access
_node_and _postgresql_:

```shell
OPT='/usr/local/opt'
PATH="$OPT/postgresql@9.6/bin:$PATH"
PATH="$OPT/node@8/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
```

### Managing brew services

Managing other services, like databases as Postgres, with brew is easy with `brew services`.
Use `brew services list` to list the installed services, `brew services run` to run a service...
execute `brew services` to get a list of commands.

Using postgres again as an example, to run it just do `brew services run postgresql@9.6`.

### Install fonts using brew

Fonts that are open-source or free to use (like from google fonts) are usually
in[brew's cask fonts](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts):

```shell
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
```

Happy configuring :-)
