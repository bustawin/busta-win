Defining goals is one of the first and most crucial steps to take when managing a team, project, or
even an organization. With so many related keywords—e.g., vision, mission, goals, objectives,
SMART, Objective and Key Results (OKRs), and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)—used in different
areas of an organization, understanding and navigating through them feel daunting. However, these
concepts are built on top of simple notions and theory that are easy to understand.

In this article, we present each concept by using theory in a simple and organized fashion. By the
end of the article, we can have an overview of the concepts and how they relate within the
different layers of an organization (from higher to lower management), ultimately aimed at
motivating and guiding people.

This article can help managers in understanding concepts and theory, and, therefore, work better
with other teams and throughout the hierarchy of an organization.

## Why all of this?
<Subtitle>What is an organization, what are the vision and mission, and why do we need goal setting?</Subtitle>

Why do organizations care about goals, objectives, and frameworks like OKRs? Let's find out by
going at the beginning.

<p><Q {...q.a}>An <dfn>organization</dfn>—such as a company or association—represents a **group of people**
  with a shared **purpose**.
</Q> <Q {...q.b}>For a company, this purpose is to get economic benefit by selling goods and
services.</Q></p>

Now let's understand what _purpose_ is. The vision and mission are two concepts that help us define
it.

<Q {...q.c} text={<span>Equaling vision to purpose is a simplification, the result of synthesizing the purpose of the organization in a statement. Defining the purpose of an organization can entail a deep multidimensional analysis of the "organization's soul". Check out <a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/4624/">Organizations with purpose: From the Editors</a></span>}
>The <dfn>vision</dfn> is the **purpose** itself of the organization. It is the _why_, that is, the reason
this group of people are together and have formed an organization.</Q> In
Qustodio (where I work), the vision is <q>to help the world maintain a safe and productive digital
  balance.</q>

<Q {...q.c}>The <dfn>mission</dfn> is _what_ the organization is going to do to achieve the vision.
It is the _what_ and _how_ of an organization</Q>.
<Q {...q.d}> You might find the mission and vision mixed together, even described as one.</Q>
For example, [Nike's mission](https://about.nike.com) has an implied vision, which is to
<Q {...q.e}>bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.</Q> This
is telling us that the vision is about athletes gaining inspiration and innovation, and that their
mission is about generating that inspiration and innovation. From this, we can extract that Nike's
focus is not about trainers, but inspiring and innovating for athletes. In the case of Qustodio, it is
<Q {...q.f}>to develop a seamless way for parents, schools, and teachers to work together to create safe and
  enriching online experiences.</Q>

A simple template to draft the vision is as follows:

```hero
We envision a world where [vision] by doing [mission].
```

In understanding the mission and vision, we talk about the organization in singular. However—as
stated above—an organization is a group of people. In order to ensure every person is up to the
task of fulfilling the mission, we use goal setting. <Q {...q.g}><dfn>Goal setting</dfn> involves the development of
an action plan designed in order to motivate and guide a person or group toward a goal</Q>,
being in our case the purpose of the organization.

Now, we know why we need goal setting: organizations are a group of people with a shared purpose,
and goal setting is how we ensure that these people work toward the purpose.

In the following sections, we see how goal setting works.

## Goal setting and goals
<Subtitle>What are goals, results, and metrics? Why are there many frameworks?</Subtitle>

As we defined it above, goal setting is about planning, motivating, guiding, and ultimately
aligning people. In the heart of goal setting are _goals_.

<Q {...q.h}>A <dfn>goal</dfn> is the result that a person or group of people wishes to achieve.</Q>
Therefore, the purpose (or vision) of the organization is their main goal. An individual can also have a goal,
such as <q>I want to lose weight</q>, or in case of a group, <q>we want to sell to the U.S. market.</q>

<Q {...q.g}><dfn>Goal setting theory</dfn> tells us how to make the most of goals to greatly motivate and guide the
people who will work toward them.</Q> Some of the buzzwords to create goals are tools—e.g. **SMART** objectives—while others
are frameworks—e.g. **OKRs**.

Given that goal setting is an overarching theory, people apply it differently, resulting in
different ways (i.e. tools and frameworks) of solving the same problems. In fact, this usually
happens inside a company. Higher management (e.g., c-suite) uses slightly different tools and
frameworks compared to middle management (e.g., department managers), but all seem to revolve
around the same concept: setting goals to guide and motivate people. For any manager reading this,
it all boils down to **choosing what best motivates and guides your team**.

Let's see what are some of the most used tools and frameworks, and their most accepted (as per my
_personal_ understanding) definitions.

### Defining "result" in a goal
<Subtitle>What is performance, metrics, KPIs, and sub-goals?</Subtitle>

<Q {...q.i}>What is the goal of a goal? It is to be _resolved_. And the process of resolving a task is what
we call <dfn>performance</dfn></Q>.

For the <q>I want to lose weight</q>, the result is a reduction of weight. The faster we lose
weight, the higher is our performance. However, how do we know that we are losing weight? This can
be observed by tracking how many kilos (or pounds) that we are losing; this is a KPI.<Q {...q.j}> A <dfn><abbr>KPI</abbr></dfn> (
Key Performance Indicator) is a metric (a.k.a. measurement or indicator) that tells us how close we
are toward completing a goal</Q>, and, therefore, how effective we are.

Since goal setting is about guiding people, **KPIs** are a way to **know** whether we are advancing correctly.

In order to lose weight, we have to engage in several activities like eating healthy or exercising.
We refer to these activities as sub-goals. A <dfn>sub-goal</dfn> is a goal whose result we require to
fulfill a greater goal.

In fact, it is not rare for **metrics** to **become** **goals** per
se—[a side read of the Goodhart's Law could be interesting](https://builtin.com/data-science/goodharts-law). The paper
_[Motivate Employee Performance through Goal‐setting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341638968_Motivate_Employee_Performance_through_Goal-setting)_
 is a useful read in how to improve performance through goal-setting.

### Everything is a goal

We defined above that an organization is a set of people with purpose, that the vision is a
purpose, and that the mission is how to achieve the purpose. If we substitute _purpose_ with
_goal_, we could say that <q>an organization is a set of people with a goal</q>, which is quite close to
the original message. Following this thought process, the mission could be the first sub-goal of an
organization.

We get to the interesting conclusion that **everything is a goal** (and a KPI as a way to measure
its completion). Thus, any organizational planning is a hierarchy of goals and sub-goals:

![Diagram representing how goals are solved in a hierarchical organization](goal-setting-vision-okrs/images/goals.svg "Diagram representing how goals are solved in a hierarchical organization")

What the goal-setting tools and frameworks do is adding rules to goals and KPIs to make them more
effective in specific _contexts_. For example, in firms, a usual context is the organizational
layers shown above—higher management, middle management, and low-level management.

## Objectives
<Subtitle>What is an objective? What differentiates an objective from a goal?</Subtitle>

An **objective** **is a <abbr>SMART</abbr> goal**. <Q {...q.l}><dfn>SMART</dfn> is a mnemotecnic term that means Specific, Measurable, Assignable,
  Realistic, and Time-related</Q>; and these are the properties that transform a goal into an
objective. Checkout [this link for a description of each property](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals/brief-history-of-smart-goals.php).
Therefore, a goal is an objective that is not SMART. <q>I want to lose weight</q> is a goal, and <q>I want
to lose 1 kilo in two weeks</q> is an objective. Due to these properties, goals are usually broader
and a bit blurry, whereas objectives are refined goals.

Many scholars and managers interchange the words
objective and goal, whereas I find it useful to separate them with a clear definition. For example,
the book [Business A Changing World](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/business-foundations-changing-world-ferrell-hirt/M9781260088366.accessibility.html)
states that <Q {...q.k}>The principal difference between goals and objectives is that objectives
are generally stated in such a way that they are measurable</Q>, which is a
SMART property.

## OKRs
<Subtitle>What is the OKR framework? Where is it used? What are the benefits?</Subtitle>

<dfn><abbr>OKRs</abbr></dfn> (Objective and Key Results) is a goal-setting framework that adds some rules on top of the
concepts we have seen above. <Q {...q.m}>OKRs is a framework tailored for the following _context_: 1) middle
managers implementing the organization strategy, and 2) not for _business-as-usual_
goals</Q>, which we explain below.

The framework divides the types of goals of middle managers into:

<dl>
  <dt>Business-as-usual goals</dt>
  <dd>Goals that are related into maintaining the day-to-day operations. An
    example for a Marketing department is launching seasonal campaigns.</dd>
  <dt>Non-business-as-usual goals</dt>
  <dd>Goals related into increasing the strategic
   competitiveness of the firm. In other words, those projects that a middle manager engages to
   increase the competitiveness of their firm. For the said Marketing department, this could be
   expanding to a new market.</dd>
</dl>

<p><Q {...q.n}>The OKRs framework is limited to the _non-business-as-usual_ goals.</Q></p>

The core terms of OKRs are 1) the Objectives and 2) the Key Results.

<dl>
<dt>Objectives</dt><dd>The framework adds a they should be significant (or meaningful) to the
 strategy of the firm or they are part of the _non-business-as-usual_ goals.</dd>
 <dt>Key Results</dt><dd>Key Results are the **KPIs** used to measure these objectives. The reasoning for not
   calling Key Results as KPIs is to help separating KPIs that track goals falling within the
   framework (i.e. tracking _non-business-as-usual_ goals) from KPIs that track goals which are
   outside the coverage of the framework (i.e. _business-as-usual goals_). In a more technical
   lingo, Key Results are a subset of KPIs.</dd>
</dl>

<Q {...q.o}>By separating goals into two and tackling the non-business-as-usual ones, the OKRs framework allows
organizations to focus on their top strategic priorities</Q> ([see the F.A.C.T acronym](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/benefits-of-okrs#benefits-of-okrs)).

## All together

The diagram below represents goal-setting in an organization using OKRs.

![Diagram representing goal-setting in an organization using OKRs](goal-setting-vision-okrs/images/OKRs.svg "Diagram representing goal-setting in an organization using OKRs")

There are more goal-setting from full-featured ones
like [OGSM (Objectives, goals, strategies and measures)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGSM) to
tools like [BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goals)](https://weekplan.net/academy/vision/bhags).

In sum, this article shows how different goal-setting frameworks and tools pivot around the same
basic concepts (i.e., goals, KPIs, and OKRs), helps understand the meaning of such concepts, and
finally maps them to identify where they are situated across an organization.
