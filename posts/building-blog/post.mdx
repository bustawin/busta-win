export const q = frontmatter.q

I moved my blog away from WordPress,
building a self-hosted one using top modern technologies like [React Remix](https://remix.run),
[server-side rendering](https://solutionshub.epam.com/blog/post/what-is-server-side-rendering), and
the [edge computing](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/).

I want something [small and joyful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)
to code and blog with total creative freedom, putting my grain of sand
to bring back an [indie Internet](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb) that empowers people to do good.

With this post, I want to introduce you to the main pieces this website is built upon (like the
server) and how to put them together to run it.
This is the **high-level architecture** of the website.

By setting things up the way I do, you have something fairly easy, efficient, secure, and modern,
which then you can use as the basis of your own website.

*And you know this works because you are reading from it.*

Specifically, I focus on setting up the project and CloudFlare as a way to learn by example,
leaving
the low-level architecture, or how does my website internally work for another post.

I assume you [Docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker) a bit.

## What I want for my personal website

The goals of this project are:

1. Give myself something basic that I can easily understand (e.g., posting
   in [Markdown files](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)).
2. Have something highly customizable that does not meddle in my way, so I have full creative
   control.
3. Allow complex UIs only when needed (e.g., some blog posts require complex graphs or tables)
4. Something I can self-host, because <C {...q.d}>there is no cloud, it is just someone else’s
   computer</C> and I want to control my data—it is fun and cheap too.
5. Lightweight to users, because people have unstable connections and
   the <C {...q.a}>Internet has become a bloated mess</C>.
6. I find coding and blogging fun.

If some resonate with you, then keep reading.

## The high level architecture

Considering these goals, I decided to build the blog with the following architecture,
which I detail and explain how to set up in the following sections:

```pintora title="This website's  arquitecture seen by  the data flow from the user requesting https://busta.win until the posts are read from a file."
componentDiagram

interface "HTTP request from user" as User
component "CDN Cache" as CDN
component "React Remix" as Remix
component "Posts in Markdown files" as Posts

rectangle "1. CloudFlare Edge" {
  [busta.win domain]
  [CDN]
  [Zero Trust]
  [busta.win domain] -- CDN
  CDN -- [Zero Trust]
}

rectangle "2. Docker Compose in a lightweight PC" {
    [Cloudflared]
    rectangle "Server" {
        [Express Server]
        [Remix]
        [Posts]
        
        [Express Server] -- [Remix]
        [Remix] -- [Posts]
    }
}

User -- [busta.win domain]
[Zero Trust] -- [Cloudflared] : Secure tunnel
[Cloudflared] -- [Express Server]
```

1. A free CloudFlare App that has:
    1. The [busta.win](https://busta.win) domain.
    2. A [CDN Cache](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/cdn/) that
       serves the blog to users. As the blog is mainly static files, the majority of times users
       hit only this cache, reducing access to our server drastically.
    3. <dfn>[Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/zero-trust)</dfn>, a service that creates
       a secure tunnel between the server and the Internet without having to configure routers or
       firewalls.
2. A lightweight computer
   (a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) in my case)
   running a Docker Compose with two services:
    1. <dfn>[Cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared)</dfn>, which connects the
       self-hosted website to the Zero Trust.
    2. An [Express](https://expressjs.com) server serving the web.
       When the user accesses the website, Express calls [React Remix](https://remix.run)
       to render the UI and the posts from the Markdown files.

Let us see in the following sections how to set up these pieces.

## The cloudFlare App

In an ideal world, we would not need Cloudflare, as we would serve the website "the old way,"
connecting the server directly to the Internet by opening ports in the router.

However, <C {...q.b}>this is insecure</C>, and
in my case, my lightweight computer is not powerful enough to handle traffic spikes.
Moreover, we have to set up HTTPS and many other details better
to avoid in the beginning.

We can use CloudFlare for free to handle all of the above, which is more simple and secure than
doing it ourselves. As a drawback, <C {...q.c}>they become a man-in-the-middle</C>, so we lose some
control of our data.
Cloudflare becomes our proxy.

We set up CloudFlare by adding a **website**:

![Adding a site](building-blog/images/cloudflare-add-website.webp "Adding a site. Checkout the 'Add a site' button at the top right of the screen.")

[Cloudflare has a guide on how to add a site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).

### The Domain

The domain is [registered](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/registrar/) with CloudFlare,
so we avoid touching any DNS settings.
Of course, we can use any domain registrar and point the domain to Cloudflare.

### Zero Trust

Once we have a website, we can link the website to our self-hosted server using Zero Trust.
<dfn>Zero Trust</dfn> is a service to control access to our self-hosted server, so we mainly have
to do two steps:

1. [Create a policy that allows anyone to access our website](#create-a-policy-that-allows-anyone-to-access-our-website).
2. [Create the tunnel connecting the website to our self-hosted server](#create-the-tunnel-connecting-the-website-to-our-self-hosted-server).

#### Create a policy that allows anyone to access our website

1. Enter into [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and complete the onboarding by
   choosing a free plan.
2. Once you are in the Zero Trust dashboard, go to *Access* → *Applications* and click on *Add an
   application*.
   ![Adding an application](building-blog/images/cloudflare-zero-trust-add-application.webp "Adding an application.")
3. Select *Self Hosted* and click *Next*.
   I left the defaults, configuring only the domain to be `busta.win`.
   ![Configuring the domain](building-blog/images/cloudflare-zero-trust-bustawin.webp "Configuring the domain.")
4. Create a policy that allows everyone to access the website.
   ![Creating a public policy](building-blog/images/cloudflare-zero-trust-public-policy.webp "Creating a public policy.")
   ![Setting the policy for everyone](building-blog/images/cloudflare-zero-trust-public-policy-everyone.webp "Setting the policy for everyone.")

#### Create the tunnel connecting the website to our self-hosted server

1. In the Zero Trust panel, go to *Networks* → *Tunnels* → *Create a
   Tunnel*. ![Adding a tunnel](building-blog/images/cloudflare-zero-trust-tunnel-add.webp "Adding a tunnel")
2. Select *cloudflared*, which is the technology we use in the Server.
3. Add the domain of the website, so Cloudflare knows what to use the tunnel for
   (i.e., providing for `busta.win` in my case).
   The `busta.win:3210` piece will make sense later.
   ![Linking the tunnel to the busta.win domain](building-blog/images/cloudflare-zero-trust-tunnel-public-hostname.webp "Linking the tunnel to the busta.win domain")
4. The next page tells you how to install Cloudflared. The most important part is to copy the <dfn>
   token</dfn>, which we use later to link the cloudflared service in our self-hosted system with
   what we have just set up.

## Running the self-hosted website

We can use [busta.win](https://busta.win) as an example of how to run a website with *cloudfared*
via Zero Tunnel.

With Docker, the trick is
in [the docker-compose of the project](https://github.com/bustawin/busta-win/blob/main/docker-compose.yml),
which I detail after:

```yaml title='A simplified version of the docker-compose file of the project, used to run the self-hosted website for production.'
services:
  bustawin:
    build:
      context: .
      target: start
    volumes:
      - ./posts:/app/posts

  tunnel:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared
    command: tunnel run
    env_file:
      - .tunnel.env
```

This file runs two services:

1. The self-hosted website itself (called `bustawin`).
    1. This service runs our Dockerfile, which runs the server at a **docker’s internal network
       port**
       of `3210`.
2. The cloudflared tunnel.
    1. The service has an `env_file: .tunnel.env`, which expects
       us to create a file called `.tunnel.env` with the **token** we got from Cloudflare.
    2. In the Cloudflare website we wrote `busta.win:3210`.
       This instructs cloudflared to link the public hostname of `busta.win` to the
       **docker internal network port** of `3210`.

So, to recap, in Cloudflare we got a token that we add in our project.
This links the project to Cloudflare’s Zero Trust.
Then, in Cloudflare we told to set the `busta.win` domain to the Docker’s
port of `3210`, which is where our server is running—everything is linked now ✨.

So, to run the website:

1. Add a `.tunnel.env` file with the Zero Trust token in the root of this project.
2. Start Docker and run `docker compose up`.

## Extras

This is just an introduction, so there are more things you can deep dive into:

<dl>
<dt>Improving the cache</dt>
<dd>
By going to your website in Cloudflare’s
*dashbaord* → *Caching* → *Configuration* you can turn on more caching features.
For example, [Always Online](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/always-online/) keeps delivering
the cached version of our site even if our server is down, which is a real possibility for
self-hosted home servers.
</dd>
<dt>Analytics</dt>
<dd>
Cloudflare provides basic Analytics that are enough to start with.
Go to your website’s dashboard → *Analytics & Logs*.
When ready to upgrade, there
are [more powerful, self-hosted, and privacy-preserving alternatives](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy?tab=readme-ov-file#analytics).
</dd>
<dt>Security</dt>
<dd>
Exposing anything on the Internet requires to follow good security practices.
* Keep the system up to date, ideally with automatic unattended upgrades.
* Follow
  [security practices for the software you use](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org).
* If using SSH to access the machine, follow practices such
  as [removing login passwords](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-disable-ssh-password-login-on-linux/)
  and [using Zero Conf to access the server through SSH remotely](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/).

## Conclusions

We have seen how to set up a self-hosted website using Cloudflare’s free services by using this
site—[busta.win](https://busta.win)—as an example.

I hope you can use this basis to build your own website 🙂.

In a future post, I will talk about the low-level architecture of the website—how React Remix works
and how I structured the code.
