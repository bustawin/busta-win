Networks and servers are unreliable: they can fail, saturate... our requests should handle these
scenarios. I created a small package in
python — [retry-requests](https://github.com/bustawin/retry-requests) —to do it for us _easily_.

The package [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and its
underlying [urrlib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3) can already handle it, however it is not
by default nor straightforward to configure.

The package retry-requests just writes the boilerplate so you don't have to — and of course you can
personalize it.

[Check it out here](https://github.com/bustawin/retry-requests).
