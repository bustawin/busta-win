---

Debian's app distribution (apt) is a simple, native, and friction-less tool to manage apps and
their dependencies. Just with the combo `apt update && apt upgrade` you ensure that systems are
up-to-date, including your software and its dependencies —and it works with Ubuntu and friends.

In this tutorial we learn how to package apps, generating .deb files, and distribute them through
_apt_ by creating a simple repository.


## Create a debian package

A Debian package is a collection of files and folders compressed in a special way. Specifically it
contains:

- A folder called _DEBIAN_ that contains:
- A file called _control_, that has information about the package (like the name, the
version...).
- Optional scripts to execute during different stages of the installation.
- Other files and folders that apt will just copy to the system where you are installing it. The
root of the package mimics the root of the computer you are installing it, and anything you put
in the package will be copied exactly. For example, if you want `/etc/foo` in your system you
create a folder called _etc_ in your package and add a file _foo_ inside.

An example for a package is as follows:

```
|-- DEBIAN
|   |-- control
|   |-- postinst
`-- etc
    `-- my-program
        |-- LICENSE
        |-- config
```

In the package above we can see the required _DEBIAN/control_ file, a _postinst_ script (which we
will analyze [later](#Mantainer_scripts)), and then an `etc/my-program/LICENSE`
and `etc/my-program/config`, two files that will be copied to the system, automatically creating
the directory `/etc/my-program` in the process.

So, to create a package start with an empty folder and just add those files.

### The DEBIAN/control file

The _DEBIAN/control_ file includes metadata about the package. Items such as the package name,
version number, and dependencies are specified here. An example with an explanation is as follows:

```
Package: mypkg
Version: 1.0-1
Architecture: all
Maintainer: My Org <hello@my.org>
Depends: foo,bar,baz
Description: my.org’s snazzy app
```

1. Package: The name of the package. It must follow
the [Debian naming conventions](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/first.en.html#namever).
2. Version: The version of the package, explained [below](#Versioning).
3. Architecture: If your package contains compiled code, the architecture for this binary,
otherwise `all`.
4. Maintainer: An RCF 822 e-mail address.
5. Depends: A comma-separated list of packages that are dependencies, which _apt_ installs before
installing your software.
6. Description: A free-form, human-readable text.

[Get here more information and options for the control file](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#binary-package-control-files-debian-control).

#### Versioning

The version number is a sensible part in the package, as a wrong value can make apt to _upgrade_
the package to an older version, which is difficult to debug and fix later. The version number must
follow [Debian versioning conventions](https://readme.phys.ethz.ch/documentation/debian_version_numbers/).

However, such convention is quite open, so we have had better results by following the more
restrictive version scheme of the Debian official repositories, simplified
as `<software version>-<debian revision>`. A `1.3-2` means that is the software version 1.3 and the
version 2 of the specific installation files and scripts. A `1.3-3` means that we changed the
installation scripts and files, but it is still based on the 1.3 version of the software.

You can compare versions and check their correctness
with `dpkg --compare-versions <v1> <comparator> <v2>; echo $?`, outputting **0 if it is True**. The
comparators are `lt le eq ne ge gt`. An example
is `dpkg --compare-versions 1.1-1 lt 1.1-2; echo $?`. You can get more info in
the [man page of dpkg](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dpkg) (look for _\--compare-versions_).

Finally, the following example illustrates the hierarchy of
versions: `1.9 < 1.12, 1.1~b1 < 1.1, 1.1 < 1.1-1 < 1.1-2`.

### Mantainer scripts

As we saw [above](#debian-packages), we can add scripts files in the DEBIAN folder. We can have up
to four script files, called _preinst, postinst, prerm,_and_postrm_, representing the stage of the
installation when the script is executed.

- _preinst_ executes before unpacking the files.
- _postinst_ executes after unpacking the files.
- _prerm_ executes before deleting the files when uninstalling.
- _postrm_ executes after removing the files when uninstalling.

[Maintainer scripts](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html#s-scripts) are regular
shell scripts with the following characteristics:

- They must be idempotent, as they can be called several times. Because of it, add guards and
prefer operations that are already idempotent (such as _chown, systemctl enable|disable_)
- They must detect errors and propagate them upwards. If the script cannot perform its tasks, it
has to notify the package system via its return code. In practice, we just add `set -e` at the
beginning of the script.
- They can be written in any scripting language by using
a [shebang](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang), as long as you ensure that such
interpreter is available (
see [pre-depends](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#binary-dependencies-depends-recommends-suggests-enhances-pre-depends)).

An example of a script is as follows:

```
#!/bin/bash

systemctl disable bar
systemctl enable foo

if ! grep "mypkg-guard" /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf; then
  cat <<EOF >>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

#mypkg-guard
[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:$iface_inside
#mypkg-guard-END
EOF
fi
```

[Here you have more information](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html).

### Building the .deb

Once you have the folders and files of your future package, build it by
executing `dpkg-deb -b <path/to/source/dir> <destination/dir>`. This results in a _.deb_ file
called _package\_version\_arch.deb_. You can install it with `apt install <deb-file.deb>`.

## Setting up an apt repository

A Debian repository is an HTTP server that allows to access the _.deb_ files in a regular folder of
your server machine. This folder includes too a special _Packages.gz_ file that is an index of the
packages your repository offers, which apt gets when performing `apt update`.

For this example we use Apache to setup the repository.

1\. Install apache with `apt install apache2`.  
2\. Create a file in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/packages.my.org.conf` with the following
contents:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        DocumentRoot /path/to/repo
 
        <Directory /path/to/repo>
        # We want the user to be able to browse the directory manually
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Multiviews
        Require all granted
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

`/path/to/repo` is the path you want your repository files to be in. An example
is `/home/<user>/repository/`.

3\. Give the apache user access to the folder. A quick way is by adding apache to the user group
that created the folder: `adduser www-data my-user`.  
4\. Enable the site: `a2enmod packages.my.org`.  
5\. Restart apache: `apachectl restart`.  
6\. Go to the URL of your repository with a browser to see an empty directory. Otherwise you should
fix your configuration.  
7\. Move the .deb files you built before to `/path/to/repo`, and do **not** change the
name `dpkg-deb` gives them.  
8\. Run `dpkg-scanpackages --multiversion -- /path/to/repo | gzip -9c > /path/to/repo/Packages.gz`,
which generates a suitable index file for `apt update`.

Redo step 6 and 7 every time you add new packages.

Now, in every computer you want to install packages from the repository, add the following line, as
usual, to `/etc/apt/sources.list`: `deb http://url.to.my.repo /`.

_apt install / upgrade_ will fail because the repository is not signed. Use _apt-**get** install /
upgrade_ instead and ignore the warning. Signed repositories are more difficult to create and,
thus, are not part of this introductory tutorial. I would appreciate a guide or tutorial that
explains it so I can link them here, or how to make apt work with unsigned repositories.

Happy coding :-)
