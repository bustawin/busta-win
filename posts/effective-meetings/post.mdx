Bad meetings are bad for business. In 2019, Doodle reported that <Q {...q.doodle}>Poorly organized
or canceled meetings pose the biggest time drain to businesses in the UK, with 40% of employees
believing this is the biggest threat to their company’s time.</Q>,
and <Q {...q.doodle}>Professionals spend an average
of two hours in pointless meetings every week.</Q>

Quoting Antony Jay, <Q {...q.hbr} direct>meetings […] are useful only if they are seen by all present to be getting
somewhere—and somewhere they know they could not have gotten to individually.</Q> So, I am to explain how to make meetings effective, ensuring we reached what we wanted.

Although we all have done hundreds of meetings, probably we haven't spent enough time
wondering why we meet, so that's the first section of this post. Then,
I provide instructions how to make a meeting effective, starting by preparing it,
and running it.

## Why we meet
<Subtitle>The functions of a meeting</Subtitle>

<Q {...q.hbr}>Knowing the functions of a meeting helps us understand why we create them,
and why we behave like we do in them</Q>:

* A meeting defines the team. Those present belong to it; those absent don't.
* A meeting is the place where the group revises, updates, and adds to what it knows as a team: it's shared knowledge.
* A meeting helps individuals understand the collective aim of the team and the way in which his own and everyone else's work can contribute to it.
* A meeting creates a commitment to the decisions taken. Once something has been decided, even if you originally argued against it, your membership in the group entails an obligation to accept the decision.
* A meeting is a status arena, where people find out their relative standing against others.

When we create a meeting, we accept and pursue the previous statements.

## Preparing the meeting
### Set an objective
Start by defining the **objective** of the meeting. The following questions can aid you to create a good objective:

* What do I want to achieve with this meeting?
* What would be the likely consequences of not holding it?
* After the meeting, how do I judge whether it was a success or a failure?



### Define what you expect from the meeting
Then, ensure it’s clear what you expect from people. 
You can divide meetings into three broad types:

<dl>

<dt>Meetings to inform</dt>
<dd>

<Q {...q.hbr}>Where you want to introduce something that might raise questions.</Q> 
<Q {...q.cambridge}>They are also known as Process-Oriented, as knowledge is shared and information exchanged.</Q>
Examples are team meetings, project status meetings, and announcements.

<Q {...q.typesMeetingWorth}>This type of meetings might be better off handled asynchronously, like via email, and Instant Message, or a post in the company’s intranet.</Q>
For example, <Q {...q.mckinsey}>recurring meetings can become diffuse over time (and might require reviewing with stakeholders to ensure that the frequency is right).</Q>
</dd>

<dt>Meetings to discuss or decide</dt>
<dd>

<Q {...q.cambridge}>These are Mission-oritented, as in there's a specific output to them, usually a decision</Q>. For example:
* <Q {...q.hbr}>Deciding *what shall we do?*, resulting in a new policy, project, task, etc. where people contribute with ideas and knowledge</Q>.
* <Q {...q.hbr}>Deciding *how shall we do it?*, starting with a goal and finishing with a plan. As the team participated in the decision-making, the decision belongs to the team—securing the group’s consent. Moreover, this kind of meeting ensures each member understands, owns, and commits to their part</Q>

<Q {...q.mckinsey}>So, ensure you invite the necessary people to take a decision, otherwise the meeting will be useless.</Q>

These meetings are skippable if a single person can take autonomously the decision. <Q {...q.mckinsey}>Your company’s culture can encourage meetings rather than individual decision making, and you might be further advocating it by making or accepting them.</Q>
</dd>

<dt>A mix of types</dt>
<dd>

Meetings might serve as a placeholder for several topics to discuss. Topics might be either to inform, or discuss/decide.
</dd>
</dl>

### Create the meeting
Finally, create the meeting in your Calendar app. This should contain:

1. A specific title related to the topic. <Note text={<span>
   <p>It should be the objective of the meeting, or related.</p>
   <p><Q {...q.stanfordReport}>Don't put the word <em>meeting</em> or any synonym for it in the title; rather, include an action specific to your purpose. For example, instead of <em>Update meeting</em> or <em>Process Improvement Summit</em>, take a marketing mindset and have the meeting title be <em>App Launch</em> or <em>Catalyzing Research Effectiveness</em>.</Q></p></span>}>A
   good title related to the objective and the category of the meeting.</Note>
2. Think of how long the meeting should take. If it feels too long, divide the meeting.
3. <p>Put the meeting at a time when your participants are going to be productive.</p>
   <p><em>When is the best time to setup a meeting?</em> Doodle's research reports that <Q {...q.doodle}>70% of professionals reported that meetings are best held in the morning (8am – 12pm), as opposed to the afternoon (19%), and before work/evenings (11%)</Q>.
   Moreover, <Q {...q.microsoft}>avoid putting a meeting in the middle of a big time gap and thus breaking the focus of the people, nor after a chain of lengthy meetings where they are exhausted. Breaks between meetings allow the brain to “reset,” reducing a cumulative buildup of stress across meetings</Q>.</p>
4. Add a link to the agenda (see next section) in the description, if any.
5. Define who is the Chairman (see next section).

## The agenda

<Q {...q.stanford}>Share an agenda if the meeting has more than one or two topics (a.k.a agenda items),</Q>
<Q {...q.hbr}> and do it 2-3 days before the meeting—less than that and people won’t review the topics; more than that and they might forget</Q>.

**For each topic** in the agenda:

1. Write a title in the form of an **action**, a **goal** of what you want to achieve once the topic is concluded, 
   in a similar way you categorized the meeting itself and defined the title. It should tell people **what** you want to do with them, so they know where they are trying to get to.
   * A wrong example is: "development budget".
   * A good example is: <Q {...q.hbr} direct>Discuss the proposal for reduction to the next year's development budget now that the introduction of our new product has been postponed"</Q>.
2. All topics should be thought in advance if they are to be usefully discussed.
   * <Q {...q.hbr}>Share short drafts or proposals to help reaching the goal of the item of the agenda, helping people in formulating useful questions and considerations in advance. Avoid long ones</Q>.
   * Provide context to people: add references and previous meeting, including decisions taken.
   * Note points that you want to be ensured they are discussed in each item (you don't have to share all of them in the public agenda), in order to guide the discussion.
3. Put the expected finishing time of a topic on the agenda.
4. Define who is the Chairman (if differs from the meeting one; more on this later) and Task Leader (more on this later).
5. Leave a space for next steps, and write any you already know of.

<details>
<summary>Sort the topics on the agenda wisely: by urgency, mental energy, interesting ones, and whether they are divisive topics.</summary>

According to <Q {...q.hbr}>Antony Jay</Q>:
* First, the ones requiring urgent decision, vs those that can wait till next time.
* Then, those that require mental energy or bright ideas, as the early part of the meeting is more lively and creative than the end of it.
* A divise or interesting item that can take long time can go later the end to ensure other items are processed.
* Some items unite the meeting in a common front, while others divide them. Make a conscious decision of what you prefer (start unified then divide, or otherwise).
* Avoid welling on trivial but urgent items but excluding important ones whose significant is longterm rather than immediate.

# The roles of people in meetings
These are the roles of the people in meetings. It is important to understand in which role people fall, what they have to do, and that they are explicitly set in the meeting.

<dl>
<dt>Chairman</dt>
<dd>

(a.k.a. Chairperson). They are the social leaders of the meeting. They ensure that the meeting achieves the best conclusions—the agenda topics are solved—efficiently (eg. without derailing) by acting as a facilitator.

* They are usually the person setting up the meeting. 
* They should be acting as a servant leader.
* Guiding the group to achieve conclusions via the [socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method).
  * Moving the discussion forward, cutting when it derails (e.g. by saying “we have to move on”).
  * Preventing misunderstanding and confusion.
  * Encouraging the clash of ideas (probing, stimulating, summarizing) and avoiding the clash of personalities.
  * They should not have strong opinions nor impose them.
  * Ensuring everyone participates, including silent and junior people that might be intimidated by senior ones.

<details>
<summary>Watch out for the suggestion-squashing reflex.</summary>

According to <Q {...q.hbr}>Antony Jay</Q>:

> Suggestions contain the seeds of future success. 
> Although very few suggestions will ever lead to anything, almost all of them need to be given every chance. 
> The trouble is that suggestions are much easier to ridicuel than facts or opinions. 
> If people feel that making a suggestions will provoke the negative reaction of being laughed at or squashed, they will soon stop.

* Few suggestions can stand up to squashing in their pristine state.
* Notice and show special warmth when anyone makes a suggestion.
* Pick out the best part of one and get the other members to help build it into something that might work.
</details>

</dd>
<dt>Task leader</dt>
<dd>

(a.k.a. project leader). They are the owner of a topic in the agenda, and lead the discussion of that topic.

<details>
<summary>Chairman VS task leader</summary>

<Q {...q.hbr}>The Chairman can be the Task Leader, although it’s not advisable. Research shows that most of the effective discussions have these two leaders separately.</Q>

<Q {...q.hbr}>The reasoning is that the task leader can have strong arguments and take decisions—be a master leader—whereas the chairman should be a servant leader, as in facilitating people to make arguments and take decisions. The Chairman has to be perceived to be committed to the combined objective and neutral, instead of advocating one side of the argument, otherwise they loose credibility.</Q>

</details>
</dd>
<dt>Secretary</dt>
<dd>

(a.k.a. note or minute taker). <Q {...q.cambridge}>Although the Chairman is the responsible for taking notes, this can be delegated or shared with a participant. The purpose of the minutes is to capture what was discussed, and more importantly, what was agreed at a meeting</Q>.
</dd>
<dt>Attendees</dt>
<dd>

<Q {...q.cambridge}>Attendees are accountable for participating and contributing to the meeting.</Q>

<details>
<summary>McKinsey divides attendees into decision maekrs, adviers, recommenders, and execution partners.</summary>

> * Decision makers should be the only participants with a vote, and the ones with the responsibility to decide as they see fit. Sometimes decision makers will need to “disagree and commit,” to use a phrase coined by Jeff Bezos in a 2017 letter to Amazon shareholders. 
> * Advisers give input and shape the decision. They typically have a big stake in the decision’s outcome. 
> * Recommenders conduct analyses, explore alternatives, illuminate pros and cons, and ultimately recommend a course of action to the advisers and decision makers. The more recommenders the better—for the process, not the decision meeting itself. 
> * Execution partners don’t give input in making the decision but are deeply involved in implementation. For optimal speed and clarity, execution partners should be in the room when the decision is made so that they can envision how the implementation will evolve from the decision.

The Cambridge’s [Effective Meetings Toolkit](https://www.ppd.admin.cam.ac.uk/files/meeting_toolkit_2023.pdf) has trainings for each role.

# Discussing in a meeting

Some topics of an agenda are discussions. According to <Q {...q.hbr}>Antony Jay</Q>, structure a discussion as follows:

1. Start with a symptom 
   1. Introduce the topic of discussion.
2. List a case history of all relevant facts (e.g. when did this start happening? did we talk about this or taken a related action before?).
3. Include what's happening today
4. Go through a diagnosis by 
   1. Constructing a series of explanations and options without discarding any. 
   2. Start choosing among them.
5. A discussion is done when, either 
   1. More facts are required. 
   2. There is a need for the views of people not present. 
   3. Members need more time to think and discuss. 
   4. Events are changing and likely to alter or clarify the basis of the decision soon. 
   5. There's not going to be enough time in the meeting left to discuss it. 
   6. It became clear that a few members can settle the discussion outside the meeting, without taking up time of the rest. 
6. By the end of a discussion 
   1. The Chairman summarizes what has been agreed on. 
   2. Ensures the conclusion and relevant information has been written in the minutes. 
   3. If there are actions to do resulting from the meeting, these are described as objectives and assigned to someone; they can be as narrow as a Next Action. The Chairman confirms the actions with each responsible member and writes it in the document.
