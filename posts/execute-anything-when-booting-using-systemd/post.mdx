A concise explanation about executing a script at boot by using systemd and a regular user account,
instead of root.

I wanted to execute a docker container every time I boot my Ubuntu / Debian accessing some
directories from my user directory. This should work in any linux using systemd, like Fedora or
ArchLinux.

First, create the following file at `~/.config/systemd/user/<myscript>.service`, where `~` is the
home folder of the user you want to run the script as, and `<myscript>` is any name you want to use
to identify the script. Note that you might have to create those directories:

```
[Unit]
Description=A description of this service

[Service]
ExecStart=<path to execute script> <script argument1...>
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

I choose to restart on failure, so I have my service on all the time I want it to be. You can
change or even remove the `Restart` directive. To change the directory your script executes, use
the `WorkingDirectory=<abs/path>` directive after `[Service]`.

Then, enable the service so it starts at boot: `systemctl --user enable <myscript>`.

Optionally, you can try to run the script with `systemctl --user start <myscript>` to check for
errors and `journalctl --user-unit <myscript>` to check the logs.

Now, the script runs only when you login with that user. To really enable it on boot,
execute `loginctl enable-linger <username>`.
