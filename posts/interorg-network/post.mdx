In a study [published at the Social Networks journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037887332200034X)
with [Ryan Federo](https://ryanfedero.com), we explored the structural characteristics of the
global interorganizational network (GIN)—comprising multinational companies (MNCs),
intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
—before and during a global pandemic (i.e. COVID-19).

The main takeaway of this research is to demonstrate how to capture and analyze the global
interorganizational network by using media-reported events extracted from big data compiled by
the [GDELT project](https://www.gdeltproject.org) and
the [Goldstein Scale](https://www.jstor.org/stable/174480).

[You can access the open dataset we extracted from GDELT in here](https://www.bustawin.com/interorg-network-dataset/),
which we used in our network analysis.

## The interactive network graphs

Here are the visual representations of the network that emerged from our analysis. The following
two graphs are the interactive network graphs of the GIN before and during COVID-19, respectively.
You can freely identify the organizations constituting the network by hovering the pointer over the
nodes. The circles (nodes) in orange are MNCs; blue are IGOs; and gray are NGOs. The lines (edges)
in green are on average cooperative interactions between the nodes, while those in red are
conflictive ones.

## The degree of coreness in the network

The following graphs show the degree of coreness in the network.

## Sub-groups

Ultimately, our multi-level analysis of the network allowed us to conclude that the GIN is
simultaneously characterized by fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity. Interestingly, we
find that this network is highly concentrated on the usual suspects and the actors forming the
network behave differently before and during COVID-19.
