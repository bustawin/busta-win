In a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037887332200034X)
published at the Social Networks journal
with [Ryan Federo](https://ryanfedero.com), we explored the structural characteristics of the
global interorganizational network (GIN)—comprising multinational companies (MNCs),
intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
—before and during a global pandemic (i.e. COVID-19).

The main takeaway of this research is to demonstrate how to capture and analyze the global
interorganizational network by using media-reported events extracted from big data compiled by
the [GDELT project](https://www.gdeltproject.org) and
the [Goldstein Scale](https://www.jstor.org/stable/174480).

The first two sections include the visual representations of the network, and the latter one the dataset that we used in our network analysis.

## The interactive network graphs

Here are the visual representations of the network that emerged from our analysis. The following
two graphs are the interactive network graphs of the GIN before and during COVID-19, respectively.
You can freely identify the organizations constituting the network by hovering the pointer over the
nodes. The circles (nodes) in orange are MNCs; blue are IGOs; and gray are NGOs. The lines (edges)
in green are on average cooperative interactions between the nodes, while those in red are
conflictive ones.

## The degree of coreness in the network

The following graphs show the degree of coreness in the network.

## Sub-groups

The next graphs display the sub-groups formed in the network.

Ultimately, our multi-level analysis of the network allowed us to conclude that the GIN is
simultaneously characterized by fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity. Interestingly, we
find that this network is highly concentrated on the usual suspects and the actors forming the
network behave differently before and during COVID-19.

## The dataset
The [dataset](/files/gobal-interorg-data.csv.zip) shows the interaction events between international organizations (e.g., the UN
providing aid to the WHO or Amnesty International criticizing the World Economic Forum), as
reported by the world media. The dataset can be useful for understanding the relational dynamics
between the organizations and the degree of cooperation of each actor. It encompasses events from
January 2018 to May 2021.

You have the dataset as follows: the legend, an exemplifying table, and a link to the file.

<summary>Ensuring data reliability</summary>

To ensure reliability of the data, we accounted for the confidence level that GDELT sets for each
of the recorded interactions. The confidence level pertains to GDELT’s reliability measure of the
likelihood that the data point actually captures the actual interaction between two actors. We
iteratively explored the levels of confidence by taking a 20% random sample at each level that we
stratified at 5% intervals (i.e., 100%, 95%, 90%, and so forth). We ultimately set the minimum
confidence level at 75%, as we found it is the threshold at which the recorded events actually
capture the interaction between the concerned international actors and the type of interaction in
which they are engaged (i.e., cooperative/conflictive).
